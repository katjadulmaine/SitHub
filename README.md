# SitHub
Sithub is an online babysitting and caregiver platform. We connect families with caregivers
and babysitters to help you be there for the ones you love when life happens, or when your just looking for a night
out. Sithub provides information and tools to help babysitters, caregivers and parents make informed, safe,
and best decisions when it comes to selecting an appropriate candidate. 

## Caregivers
Caregivers are able to create a profile with their availability and SitHub will help match them with parents needing childcare on those days. Sitters may login and update their availability any time. All caregivers will be required to provide their full name, email address, zip code, days available, and any other information relevant to their child care experience. Sitters must also create a password for logging in to update information.

## Parents
To use SitHub as a parent, you must first fill out our parent form. Upon completion of this form SitHub will match you with sitters in your area who have availability on your chosen day. Each matched sitter will have a name, profile picture, and email provided. If the sitter knows CPR, has their own transportation, is OK with pets in the home, and/or has references this info will be shown to the parent as well along with any comments or questions the sitter may have for the parent.

*The information contained in member profiles, job posts, and applications is supplied by babysitters and caregivers themselves and is not information generated or verified by SitHub. SitHub does not employ andy babysitters or caregivers directly nor are we responsible for the conduct of any care provider or care seeker*
